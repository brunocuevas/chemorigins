# API


## Introduction

Besides the user interface, we provide an API that will allow users
to access programatically. This can be very useful for analysis
that involve data from different sources (e.g. KEGG and ChemOrigins).


You can access different items using

    chemorigins.bact.wisc.edu/api/

For instance

    chemorigins.bact.wisc.edu/api/molecules/pbm-000032

should provide you the information on a molecule in JSON format.
